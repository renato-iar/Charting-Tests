# Charting-Tests
iOS Charts

Implements charts using a native UIView subclass (ChartView) to which plots may be added.
Supported plots are:

  - PiePlot (supports donuts)
  - BarPlot
  - LinePlot (supports "hard" and "smooth" plots, as well as closed plots which may be filled)
  - ScatterPlot
  - BubblePlot (similar to ScatterPlot but allows different dot sizes)
